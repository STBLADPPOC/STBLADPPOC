It champions the development of Singapore\\'s\\ntourism sector, one of the country\\'s key service sectors and economic pillars,\\nand undertakes the marketing and promotion of Singapore as a tourism\\ndestination.\\n\\nThe tourism sector currently contributes 4 per cent to Singapore’s gross\\ndomestic product. Tourism plays an essential role in reinforcing Singapore’s\\nstatus as a vibrant global city that is a magnet for capital, businesses and\\ntalent. It also enhances the quality and diversity of leisure options for\\nlocal residents and helps to create a living environment that Singaporeans can\\nbe proud to call home.\\n\\nSTB strives to ensure that tourism remains an important economic pillar\\nthrough long-term strategic planning, and by forging partnerships, driving\\ninnovation and ensuring excellence in the tourism sector. It continues to\\nmarket Singapore’s mult\\u200bi-faceted appeal as a premier business and leisure\\ndestination, and offer empowering and customised experiences. We bring the\\nPassion Made Possible brand to life by differentiating Singapore as a vibrant\\ndestination that inspires people to share and deepen their passions. This is a\\nunified brand between STB and Economic Development Board (EDB) which will\\nallow the international marketing of Singapore for tourism and business\\npurposes. STB also regularly reviews and updates the tourism regulatory\\nframework to ensure its relevance in the current business environment, while\\nproviding support and incentives to catalyse the private sector to take the\\nlead in investing for growth.\\n\\nWhile STB leads in driving tourism development, it cannot do it alone;\\ncontinued support from industry players is crucial in ensuring the success and\\nsustainable growth of the sector. In the face of growing challenges such as\\nresource scarcity and increasingly discerning travellers, there is a need to\\nfocus on yield-driven quality growth. As such, STB and tourism industry\\nplayers have to work collaboratively to continue to innovate and create value\\nfor visitors. STB also aims to facilitate the sharing of experiences,\\nexpertise and resources among industry players to raise industry capability\\nand competitiveness, maximise business opportunities and forge long-term win-\\nwin partnerships.\\n\\nStrong support and active participation from Singapore residents are also\\nimperative to the tourism sector as they are an integral part of Singapore’s\\nidentity and appeal. STB will continue to work with tourism industry partners\\nto nurture public engagement as part of its tourism development efforts; every\\nlocal resident is a potential advocate for tourism and together, their\\ncollective ideas and energies can contribute to the sustainable development of\\nthe tourism sector.\\n\\nTo navigate the tourism sector through the next phase of growth, STB will be\\npursuing [Quality Tourism](/content/stb/en/about-stb/achieving-quality-\\ntourism.html \"Achieving Quality Tourism\") \\\\- a model of tourism development\\nthat emphasises innovative enterprise, local engagement and strong economic\\ncontribution.\\u200b\\n\\n## History\\n\\nThe Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) was first established in 1964\\nwith the mandate to promote Singapore as a tourist destination. It signalled\\nthe government’s recognition of tourism’s potential as an important\\ncontributor to the country’s economy.\\n\\nSTPB started out with a staff strength of 25. That year, Singapore welcomed\\n91,000 visitors.\\n\\nUnder STPB, the early stages of Singapore’s tourism development focused on\\nraising the awareness of Singapore as a destination and building up tourism\\ninfrastructure, including major attractions such as Sentosa Island and the\\nSingapore Zoological Gardens.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, the Board started marketing the city as a venue for conventions\\nand organised events to draw visitors.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, STPB oversaw the implementation of a S$1 billion Tourism Product\\nDevelopment Plan, which called for the preservation of the Singapore\\'s\\nhistoric districts, such as Chinatown, Little India and Arab Street, the\\nrejuvenation of the Singapore River, and the creation of new iconic products\\nand events.\\n\\nTo reflect a major shift in the way tourism was championed as a key economic\\ndriver, STPB was renamed the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in 1997. STB\\nexpanded its role beyond destination promotion and started to establish\\nSingapore as a regional tourism hub for both tourism companies and tourists.\\nIt marked a decisive move towards tourism industry development, an approach\\nthat continues to distinguish STB from many other national tourism\\norganisations that focus almost exclusively on marketing and promotional\\nactivities.\\n\\n## Corporate Identity\\n\\nThe Board\\'s new name and corporate identity were officially unveiled by then-\\nSecond Minister for Trade and Industry BG (NS) George Yeo on 19 November 1997\\nto reflect the Board expanding its role beyond that of simply promoting\\ntourism.\\n\\nThe new identity of the Singapore Tourism Board is encased in a shape that is\\nderived from an architectural detail found in Singapore\\'s Peranakan\\nshophouses. This, together with the \\'Singapore\\' logotype in calligraphic\\nscript, reflects the modern, multi-cultural yet distinctly Asian nature of our\\nisland republic and its people.\\n\\nThe rich green colour of the identity is corporate and distinctive. It also\\nsignifies the tropical Garden City that is home to \\u200bSTB, and continued growth\\nof Singapore’s tourism sector.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n![Tourism-Court](/content/stb/en/about-\\nstb/overview/_jcr_content/mainpar/imageandtext_1316389518/image.img.jpg/1593874303472.jpg)\\n\\n## Head Office\\n\\nSingapore Tourism Board  \\nTourism Court  \\n1 Orchard Spring Lane  \\nSingapore 247729\\n\\nTel: (65) 6736 6622  \\nFax: (65) 6736 9423  \\nTourist Information: 1800-736 2000 (toll free in Singapore only)\\n\\nQuality Service Manager: 1800 - 736 6638\\n\\nDestination Website: [www.visitsingapore.com\\n__](https://www.visitsingapore.com/)\\n\\n## Regional Offices\\n\\nSTB has an extensive network of offices spanning the globe.
