Crash Course on Python by Google,Online course,Python programming,"This course is designed to teach you the foundations in order to write simple programs in Python using the most common structures. No previous exposure to programming is needed. By the end of this course, you'll understand the benefits of programming in IT roles; be able to write simple programs using Python; figure out how the building blocks of programming fit together; and combine all of this knowledge to solve a complex programming problem. 

We'll start off by diving into the basics of writing a computer program. Along the way, you’ll get hands-on experience with programming concepts through interactive exercises and real-world examples. You’ll quickly start to see how computers can perform a multitude of tasks — you just have to write code that tells them what to do.",https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course

"Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal and Cheng Soon Ong",Ebook,Machine Learning,"We wrote a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.

The book is available at published by Cambridge University Press (published April 2020).

We split the book into two parts:

    Mathematical foundations
    Example machine learning algorithms that use the mathematical foundations

We aimed to keep this book fairly short, so we don’t cover everything.",https://mml-book.com/
The Data Science Design Manual lecture videos by Steven Skiena,Video tutorial,Machine Learning,"The Data Science Design Manual serves as an introduction to data science, focusing on the skills and principles needed to build systems for collection, analyzing, and interpreting data. As a discipline data science sits at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and machine learning, but it is building a distinct heft and character of its own.

The book covers enough material for an ""Introduction to Data Science"" course at the undergraduate or early graduate student levels. A full set of lecture slides for teaching this course are available here, along with data resources for projects and assignments, and online video lectures.

An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python,Ebook,Machine Learning,"As the scale and scope of data collection continue to increase across virtually all fields, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data. An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides a broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. This book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use contemporary tools for data analysis.

The first edition of this book, with applications in R (ISLR), was released in 2013. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023.

Each edition contains a lab at the end of each chapter, which demonstrates the chapter’s concepts in either R or Python.

The chapters cover the following topics:

    What is statistical learning?
    Regression
    Classification
    Resampling methods
    Linear model selection and regularization
    Moving beyond linearity
    Tree-based methods
    Support vector machines
    Deep learning
    Survival analysis
    Unsupervised learning
    Multiple testing",https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf

Practical Data Ethics,Online course,Ethics and Governance,"Data ethics covers an incredibly broad range of topics, many of which are urgent, making headlines daily, and causing harm to real people right now. A meta-analysis of over 100 syllabi on tech ethics, titled “What do we teach when we teach tech ethics?” found that there was huge variation in which topics are covered across tech ethics courses (law & policy, privacy & surveillance, philosophy, justice & human rights, environmental impact, civic responsibility, robots, disinformation, work & labor, design, cybersecurity, research ethics, and more– far more than any one course could cover). These courses were taught by professors from a variety of fields. The area where there was more unity was in outcomes, with abilities to critique, spot issues, and make arguments being some of the most common desired outcomes for tech ethics course.

In this course, we will focus on topics that are both urgent and practical. In keeping with my teaching philosophy, we will begin with two active, real-world areas (disinformation and bias) to provide context and motivation, before stepping back in Lesson 3 to dig into foundations of data ethics and practical tools. From there we will move on to additional subject areas: privacy & surveillance, the role of the Silicon Valley ecosystem (including metrics, venture growth, & hypergrowth), and algorithmic colonialism. I realize this course still just covers a slice of what is a sprawling field, and I hope that it will be a helpful entry point for continued exploration.

This class was originally taught in-person at the University of San Francisco Data Institute in January-February 2020, for a diverse mix of working professionals from a range of backgrounds (as an evening certificate courses). There are no prerequisites for the course. This course is in no way intended to be exhaustive, but hopefully will provide useful context about how data misuse is impacting society, as well as practice in critical thinking skills and questions to ask.",https://ethics.fast.ai/
