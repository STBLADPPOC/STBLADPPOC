trips without registration and license. Attach are pictures on what they organize 
and charges. Instagram and Xiohongshu apps with the username called

Please look into this Matter. 
  
As it’s not right and proper to be doing a surf trips with charges that are sky high 
and earning and not even registered and licensed. While others who is registered 
and licensed and doing proper business. 
  
Hope that my name will be discreet and not known.
